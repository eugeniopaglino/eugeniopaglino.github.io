I am a postoctoral researcher at the Helsinki Institute for Demography and Population Health (University of Helsinki) and the The Max Planck â€“ University of Helsinki Center for Social Inequalities in Population Health (MaxHel Center). 
I hold a PhD in Demography and Sociology and a MA in Statistics and Data Science from the University of Pennsylvania and a BSc and MSc in Economics from Bocconi University. My substantive research interests revolve around climate change and population dynamics and inequalities in health and mortality. Methodologicaly, I apply Bayesian statistics to model population processes such as mortality and migration. 
I loves visualising data and I am interested in studying ways in which data visualisation can help researchers to communicate more clearly and to reach a wider audience. Outside of research, I like running and cycling and I am a fan of cinema and D&D.
