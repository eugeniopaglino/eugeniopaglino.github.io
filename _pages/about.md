I am a rising fourth-year PhD student in Demography and Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania and M.A. candidate in Statistics at the Wharton School. I hold a BSc and a MSc in Economics and Social Sciences from Bocconi University. 

I apply Bayesian statistics, data science tools, and demographic methods to the study of population processes. My research interests include the interaction between environmental change and population processes, health and mortality disparities, and Bayesian data analysis. I loves visualising data and I am interested in studying ways in which data visualisation can help researchers to communicate more clearly and to reach a wider audience. Outside of research, I like running and cycling and I am a fan of cinema and D&D.
